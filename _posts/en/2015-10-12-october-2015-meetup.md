## Topic

This month we're talking pale ales and we're encouraging everyone to bring their own efforts at home-brewing a classic American-style pale ale. We'll be discussing the style itself as well as comparing each homebrew recipe and brew method. This bar has a unique collection of imported beers, especially American beers, including Kunming's finest selection of IPAs.

Anyone can attend for free and everything is presented in both Chinese and English. The only rule is that everyone buys at least 1 beer from the bar.

> If you have any trouble finding the location or want to ask anything about the meetup, then either phone on [186-1200-9701](tel:18612009701) or join our [Wechat Group](/media/qr-code.jpg).
