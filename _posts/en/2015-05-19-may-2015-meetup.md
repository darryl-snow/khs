## Topic

Continuing from last month, we'll be tasting the remaining potential off-flavours than a brewer may encounter. Whether you're a homebrewer, a professional brewer, a cicerone in training, or just an avid drinker, you'll definitely want to attend this one. We're going to be tasting 12 off-flavours - flavours that you might get in a beer that's somehow turned out wrong or gone bad - by spiking some lager with various chemicals. We'll learn how to taste beer and detect these flavours, as well as what may have caused them. The chemicals used are perfectly safe, in fact some of them may even improve the beer!

There will be an additional cost for this meetup:

* ¥35 - members
* ¥70 - non-members

As usual, anyone is welcome to attend, but we do ask that you RSVP to [hello@kunmingbeer.org](mailto:hello@kunmingbeer.org) so that we know how much materials to prepare.

> If you have any trouble finding the location or want to ask anything about the meetup, then either phone on [186-1200-9701](tel:18612009701) or join our [Wechat Group](/media/qr-code.jpg).
