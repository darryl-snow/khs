## When:

Tuesday 21<sup>st</sup> October
**20:30**

## Location info:

SMWC Hops is a beer and whiskey tasting lounge just inside the North 2nd Ring Road. It's cosy - enough seating for about 10 people because most of the space is taken up by their gynormous beer selection. For more information on the location and to see the beer menu (you might need to take some time to consider your options before you arrive!) check out the post about it here: [http://kunmingbeer.org/smwc-hops/](http://kunmingbeer.org/smwc-hops/).

## Monthly meetup Info:

* Meet fellow homebrewers in Kunming
* Share knowledge about sourcing ingredients and equipment
* Share knowledge about making beer, cider and mead at home.

This month's topic will be: **Mashing Basics**

This month we'll also be opening official membership. Fees will be ¥50/person for membership lasting until Chinese New Year. Annual membership starting at CNY will be ¥200/person or ¥300/family.


Membership will get you access to the ingredients co-op where you will be able to buy from a select range of grains, hops, and yeast at cost price. Membership is completely optional and everyone is invited to join the meetups.
