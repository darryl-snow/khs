## Topic

Ever wanted to learn how beer is made?

This month we'll be visiting Kunming's finest brew pub! Newly opened in 2015, all the shiny new equipment is on display for everyone to see. Dave will give us an introduction to what everything does and how it all works, as well as what beers he has on offer. The KHS will offer everybody 1 free sample of each beer and then we will have an open Q&A session about everything related to brewing beer, including how you can do it at home! We'll also have a few announcements to make and discuss the future of the KCBS. Of course, we'll also have some home-brewed beers for everyone to taste!

Anyone can attend for free and everything is presented in both Chinese and English. The only rule is that everyone buys at least 1 Humdinger beer. If you or anyone you know is a fan of real beer, then you won't want to miss this!
