Where better to toast farewell to the last KHS meetup of the year of the horse than Kunming's first microbrewery/brewpub? With 6 beers on tap and a stocked fridge we shouldn't go thirsty if we run out of homebrew. It's a bit tricky to find if you haven't been there before so stay in touch on the Wechat group.

## Topic

There is no topic this month, so instead we're just going to do some KHS housekeeping:

* KHS meetup topics for 2015
* KHS meetup schedule
* New co-op ingredients for 2015
* KHS officer posts
* Shenzhen craft beer festival

> If you have any trouble finding the location or want to ask anything about the meetup, then either phone on [186-1200-9701](tel:18612009701) or join our [Wechat Group](/media/qr-code.jpg).
