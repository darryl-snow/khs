[Ray](malto:ray.denning@gmail.com) sent through these photos of Kunming's nearest American-style brew shop, in Hong Kong. So if any home brewers are there on a holiday or visa run they may want to consider picking up some supplies (for themselves or... you know... friends :). They also run brewing workshops and classes that could make your trip more interesting.
