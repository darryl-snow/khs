One of our local homebrewers asked us tonight if we knew of a list anywhere online of all* the craft beer available in China? Well, we didn't so we decided to make one. Please feel free to mention in the comments if the list is wrong, needs changing, or if you can recommend any additions! We'll gradually update this list with more info, including locations and links to official websites etc.
