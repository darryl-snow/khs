And so it began on Saturday the 16th of August 2014, at O'Reilly's Irish Pub on Beichen North Street. Following a few posts on (gokunming.com)[http://www.gokunming.com], weixin, and weibo, we arrived not knowing if anyone would turn up. In the end we had a couple of Aussies who are already set to brew! We had a few drinks - Vedett Blond and Beer Lao -, had a look at some equipment and ingredients, and covered the basics of brewing. We're looking forward to trying Caity and Nick's first batch!
